# @SBIT description short description
#
# @SBIT hint  -1   Wrong number of arguments. Should be 1. Please check args in your test file
# @SBIT hint   1   Refid is not as expected. You should check manually output of ntpq -p
# @SBIT hint   2   Remote source is not known or used. You should check the server definition in /etc/ntp.conf
# @SBIT hint   3   Remote source is used more than once. It should not happen. Please check the outpout of the ntpq -p command, and the server definition in /etc/ntp.conf

# this script) as a @SBIT hint. Hints are using two arguments. First is an index,

# will be printed by the sbit engine as an "hint" to the tester.

# Expect hint to be displayed like this "Error 3 occured. You should check this"
