# Defines the list of path to the test library to be used. By modifying this value,
# the default path will be overriden (default is /usr/share/sbit/test-library)
# and replaced by the value set in the test_library_path variable.
test_library_path:
  - "/usr/share/sbit/test-library"

# The variable aggregation_level defines the default value of the aggregation
# level. By default this variable is unset, thus all the test results will be
# displayed.
# aggreagation_level: 3

# Defines the path to the directory where the test suits are stored. By default
# the test_suite_path is not set. This variable is used when a test file is
# passed on the command line with location inforamtion (only the filename, no
# directory). If the file is not found in the current directory, sbit will search
# the file in the directory pointed by the test_suite_library variable.
# test_suite_path: "../examples/test-suites"
